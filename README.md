This repository contains two subtastks:

* Suspension system

* Wheel assembly

## Suspension system

* In this task I designed a suspension system that consists of spring mass & suspension and a tyre, this suggested suspension system will ensure a stable movement of the robot's body with very little vibration.

* Click here to see my 3D design for the suspension system on onshape website.

## Wheel assembly

* In this task I relied on the given wheel measurements to create a 3D design for the wheel, also I made some modifications on leg7.stl file to make it suitable to add the wheel.
* Click here to see my 3D design for the wheel addition on onshape website.
* Click here to see the wheel added to the leg in stl file.
* Clcik here to see the leg7 after the modifications in stl file.
